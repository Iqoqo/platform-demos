Usage demos for the IQOQO platform

## Gender in news

An NLP research of gender appearnces gap in 150,000 publication from 15 different news websites usign the IQOQO distribution framework.
Code is based on an [article by Neal Caren](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/nealcaren/5105037) and evaluates [all the news](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news) dataset

## Compare Machine learning methods

An analysis comparing different Machine learning methods (using the sklearn package).
You can see the original script in the following articale: https://pythondata.com/.

The original data from the articale is data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The “Dataset” column is a class label used to divide groups into liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease).

In our script the data was replaced with the following data:

This data was taken from a high-energy physics research.
The search for exotic particles requires sorting through a large number of collisions to find the events of interest. This data set challenges one to detect a new particle of unknown mass.
Machine learning is used in high-energy physics experiments to search for the signatures of exotic particles. These signatures are learned from Monte Carlo simulations of the collisions that produce these particles and the resulting decay products. In each of the three data sets here, the goal is to separate particle-producing collisions from a background source.
