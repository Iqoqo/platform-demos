# Are news papers sex biased?

Women are 51% of the population, but when it comes to public life out of XXX members of congress only YYY are women, out of WWW members of the House of Seanat only QQQ are woman. Looking at the business world the numbers are not **much** better, out of CCC Fortune 500 CEOs only AAA are women and in the Fortune 1000 list the women persentage is **not mush better** and stands ot a rate of JJJ.

We decided to check the ratio of female presence in news papers to see if the state there is as dare as it is in politics and business. to do so we took as base line the work of AAA which used Netural Language Processing (NLP) on the BBC publications to check the gender split there and augmented it based on the AAA data set of 150,000 articles from 15 newspapers.
To make the job run faster we used IQOQO framework to distribute the calculation.


## Ways to improve

1. Better word vector for gender classification
1. Larger and more up-t-date data-set of articles.
